# OTel x Prometheus Interoperability Survey

## Purpose

The purpose of this survey is to:
* Determine user sentiment around Prometheus Metric naming
* Determine if there is a difference of opinions between user groups:
    * Prometheus "experts" vs OTel "experts"
    * Developers (writing instrumentation) vs Operators (running agents, writing queries/alerts)
    * OSS Users (Collector, Prom Server, Thanos) vs users of Managed Services.
* Learn overall sentiment about the compatibility of the two projects
